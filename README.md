**Frontend Readme**

In order to run our website we need firstly to run frontend on server http://team5.hopto.org and then backend on server http://team5.hopto.org/api/hello
In order to run locally, we need firstly to set up properties and make docker-compose up for backend and for frontend docker-compose up.

In order to run this you need to import 2 things. Firstly write in IntelliJ IDEA terminal cd node_modules and then npm install bootstrap --save and then npm install axios --save After importing those things you can run frontend, that is why the pipeline build test failed
